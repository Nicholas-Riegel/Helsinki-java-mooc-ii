// Implement a class called Dog that inherits from Animal. Dog should have a parameterized constructor that can be used to name it. The class should also have a non-parameterized constructor, which gives the dog the name "Dog". Another method that Dog must have is the non-parameterized bark, and it should not return any value (void). Like all animals, Dog needs to have the methods eat and sleep.

public class Dog extends Animal implements NoiseCapable {

    public Dog(String name){
        super(name);
    }

    public Dog(){
        super("Dog");
    }

    public void bark(){
        System.out.println(getName() + " barks");
    }

    public void makeNoise(){
        bark();
    }
}
