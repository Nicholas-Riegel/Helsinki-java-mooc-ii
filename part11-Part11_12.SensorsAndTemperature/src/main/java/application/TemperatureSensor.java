// Create a class TemperatureSensor that implements the Sensor interface.

// At first a temperature sensor is off. When the method read is called and the sensor is on, the sensor randomly chooses an integer in the range -30...30 and returns it. If the sensor is off, the method read throws an IllegalStateException.

// Use the ready-made Java class Random to choose the random number. You'll get an integer in the range 0...60 by calling new Random().nextInt(61); â€” to get a random integer in the range -30...30 you'll have to subtract a suitable number from the random number in the range 0...60.
